# Print-Name-Gender-in-C-Language


You are required to write a complete program to perform the following:


Write a function called getWelMsg that takes the two parameters, a string (name) and a character (gender).
The function should do the following:

check the gender of the user (m (or M) for male and f (or F) for female). If the entered gender is valid, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, return null.
create a string called welMsg as a welcome message to the user based on the provided name and gender. The format of the welMsg is either "Welcome Mr. name" or "Welcome Miss. name" (see examples below). 
the size of the welMsg string should be exactly the number of letters of the created welcome message.
return string welMsg. 
In the main:

Ask the user to enter his name and store it in a string called userName (assume maximum size is 20 chars)
Ask the user about his gender (Male or Female) (a character)
call the function getWelMsg by passing userName and gender and print the result on the screen.
Examples
if the user’s name is “Ahmad” and his gender is Male, the welMsg will be  “Welcome Mr. Ahmad” exactly. 

if the user’s name is “Fatima” and his gender is Female, the welMsg will be  “Welcome Miss. Fatima” exactly.
